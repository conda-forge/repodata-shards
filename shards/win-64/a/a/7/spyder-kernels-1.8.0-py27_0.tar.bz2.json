    "description": "Provides Jupyter kernels for use with the consoles of Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment. These can launched either through Spyder itself or in an independent Python session, and allow for interactive or file-based execution of Python code in different environments, all inside the IDE. For more on Spyder, visit https://www.spyder-ide.org/  To learn about creating, connecting and using Spyder's consoles, read: https://docs.spyder-ide.org/ipythonconsole.html  For advice on managing packages and environments with Spyder, see: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Working-with-packages-and-environments-in-Spyder",
