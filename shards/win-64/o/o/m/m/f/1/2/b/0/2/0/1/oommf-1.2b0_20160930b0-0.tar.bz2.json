{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"The Object Oriented MicroMagnetic Framework (OOMMF) forms a completely functional micromagnetics package. OOMMF is written in C++. For portable user interfaces, it uses Tcl/Tk so that OOMMF operates across a wide range of Unix, Windows, and MacOSX platforms.  The recipe for building OOMMF conda package was developed by Thomas Kluyver, Ryan A. Pepper, Marijan Beg, and Hans Fangohr at the University of Southampton and European XFEL GmbH as a part of OpenDreamKit \u2013 Horizon 2020 European Research Infrastructure project (676541).  This conda package version contains Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya extensions, for crystallographic classes Cnv, T(O), and D2d, which which are not included in the OOMMF binaries and tarballs from NIST.
