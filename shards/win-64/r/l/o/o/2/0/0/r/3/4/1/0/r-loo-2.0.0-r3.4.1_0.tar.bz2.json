The approximation uses Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of the calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for the comparison of predictive errors between models. The package also  provides methods for using stacking and other model weighting techniques  to average Bayesian predictive distributions.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1594770185,"version":"2.0.0"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-loo-2.0.0-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*","r-matrixstats >=0.50.0"],"license":"GPL (>= 3)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"79d3ee6bc344e6289a06c31e3650e30e","name":"r-loo","platform":"win","sha256":"1d21be541ed14894463fd4967cba146a64fa8958ff209332afd6f16cbd8f69e0","size":760472,"subdir":"win-64","version":"2.0.0"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-loo-2.0.0-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
