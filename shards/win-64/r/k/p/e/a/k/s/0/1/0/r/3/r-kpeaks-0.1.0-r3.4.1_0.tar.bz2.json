An optimal value of this input argument is widely determined by using some internal validity indices. Since most of the existing internal indices suggest a k value which is computed from the clustering results after several runs of a clustering algorithm they are computationally expensive. On the contrary,  the package 'kpeaks' enables to estimate k before running any clustering algorithm. It is based on a simple novel technique using the descriptive statistics of peak counts of the features in a data set.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588584999,"version":"0.1.0"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-kpeaks-0.1.0-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*"],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"300f764080682935428a7409e6f73c94","name":"r-kpeaks","platform":"win","sha256":"1d324492203945d121e35d3ec3dfafc629a3343e456f9dab7faebf6c94c7f494","size":86301,"subdir":"win-64","version":"0.1.0"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-kpeaks-0.1.0-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
