This package provides high level R wrapper functions to easily utilize 'ZeroMQ'. We mainly focus on interactive client/server programming frameworks. For convenience, a minimal 'ZeroMQ' library (4.2.2) is shipped with 'pbdZMQ', which can be used if no system installation of 'ZeroMQ' is available.  A few wrapper functions compatible with 'rzmq' are also provided.","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1588566086,"version":"0.3_1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-pbdzmq-0.3_1-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*","r-r6"],"license":"GPL-3.0","md5":"cc5d69fe38e9209d067f7710583be0c0","name":"r-pbdzmq","platform":"win","sha256":"847f43f9dce474a2394e5c78de5735a9d6d0c55c4029d117f144c9486cb028de","size":530942,"subdir":"win-64","version":"0.3_1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-pbdzmq-0.3_1-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
