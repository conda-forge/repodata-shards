The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained, but kept for compatibility of reverse depending packages for some time.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588568115,"version":"4.1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-pmcmr-4.1-r3.3.2_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.3.2_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.3.2*"],"license":"GPL (>= 3)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"3c238d2362a57ca55d1276918cf486e1","name":"r-pmcmr","platform":"win","sha256":"0f305c2d61f52fe9947a56354077a8e06fcf2611afaaa6270db000a39d346cc0","size":415285,"subdir":"win-64","version":"4.1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-pmcmr-4.1-r3.3.2_0.tar.bz2"}
