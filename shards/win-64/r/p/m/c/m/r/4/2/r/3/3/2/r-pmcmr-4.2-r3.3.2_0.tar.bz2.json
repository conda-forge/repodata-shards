The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained, but kept for compatibility of reverse depending packages for some time.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588568115,"version":"4.2"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-pmcmr-4.2-r3.3.2_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.3.2_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.3.2*"],"license":"GPL (>= 3)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"0fd8a43c07c35e2b7c33f6c6147e3e6c","name":"r-pmcmr","platform":"win","sha256":"d9ce479f08035c5f7d4dfaa1117395aa416ba2687f1f38317fc32daf45ab88a4","size":441426,"subdir":"win-64","version":"4.2"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-pmcmr-4.2-r3.3.2_0.tar.bz2"}
