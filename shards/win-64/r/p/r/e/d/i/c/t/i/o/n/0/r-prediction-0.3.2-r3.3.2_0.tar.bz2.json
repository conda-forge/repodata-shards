The 'summary()' method provides a data frame with average predictions, possibly over counterfactual versions of the data (a la the 'margins' command in 'Stata'). Marginal effect estimation is provided by the related package, 'margins' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=margins>. The package currently supports common model types (e.g., \"lm\", \"glm\") from the 'stats' package, as well as numerous other model classes from other add-on packages.
