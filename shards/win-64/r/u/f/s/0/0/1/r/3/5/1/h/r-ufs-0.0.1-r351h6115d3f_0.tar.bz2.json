Therefore, distinct functionalities are being 'consciously uncoupled' into different packages. This package contains the general-purpose tools and utilities (see the 'behaviorchange' package, the 'rosetta' package, and the soon-to-be-released 'scd' package for other functionality), and is the most direct 'successor' of the original 'userfriendlyscience' package. For example, this package contains a number of basic functions to create higher level plots, such as diamond plots, to easily plot sampling distributions, to generate confidence intervals, to plan study sample sizes for confidence intervals, and to do some basic operations such as (dis)attenuate effect size estimates.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588740682,"version":"0.0.1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-ufs-0.0.1-r351h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"r351h6115d3f_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base >=3.5.1,<3.5.2.0a0"],"license":"GPL (>= 3)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"50ba1c1b05d4b3a941c35b01e9ddb5fb","name":"r-ufs","sha256":"b3ac5ec68e6dcc875b67d062e6e97a6f337363336fbb11c2e3b8446675f13225","size":53676,"subdir":"win-64","timestamp":1538296527827,"version":"0.0.1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-ufs-0.0.1-r351h6115d3f_0.tar.bz2"}
