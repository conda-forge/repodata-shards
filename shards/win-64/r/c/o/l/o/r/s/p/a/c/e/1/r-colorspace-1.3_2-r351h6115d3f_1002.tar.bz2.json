Qualitative, sequential, and diverging color palettes based on HCL colors are provided along with corresponding ggplot2 color scales. Color palette choice is aided by an interactive app (with either a Tcl/Tk or a shiny GUI) and shiny apps with an HCL color picker and a color vision deficiency emulator. Plotting functions for displaying and assessing palettes include color swatches, visualizations of the HCL space, and trajectories in HCL and/or RGB spectrum. Color manipulation functions include: desaturation, lightening/darkening, mixing, and simulation of color vision deficiencies (deutanomaly, protanomaly, tritanomaly).","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588305326,"version":"1.3_2"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-colorspace-1.3_2-r351h6115d3f_1002.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"r351h6115d3f_1002","build_number":1002,"depends":["m2w64-gcc-libs","r-base >=3.5.1,<3.5.2.0a0"],"license":"BSD_3_clause","license_family":"BSD","md5":"cc5fc776a0a888e9b07eea6e739416dc","name":"r-colorspace","sha256":"c712996349102e4a63cd44d5522bf7c6c4056d95a65e696d463b50ce0a33a90f","size":536319,"subdir":"win-64","timestamp":1542315125818,"version":"1.3_2"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-colorspace-1.3_2-r351h6115d3f_1002.tar.bz2"}
