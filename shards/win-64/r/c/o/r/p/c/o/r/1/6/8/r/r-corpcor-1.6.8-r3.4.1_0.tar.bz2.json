The details of the method are explained in Schafer and Strimmer (2005)  <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1175> and Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007)  <DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1252>.  The approach is both computationally as well as statistically very efficient, it is applicable to \"small n, large p\" data,  and always returns a positive definite and well-conditioned covariance matrix.   In addition to inferring the covariance matrix the package also provides  shrinkage estimators for partial correlations and partial variances.   The inverse of the covariance and correlation matrix  can be efficiently computed, as well as any arbitrary power of the  shrinkage correlation matrix.  Furthermore, functions are available for fast  singular value decomposition, for computing the pseudoinverse, and for  checking the rank and positive definiteness of a matrix.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588541364,"version":"1.6.8"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-corpcor-1.6.8-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*"],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"784929b01cee7f14fb3dfa189182b866","name":"r-corpcor","platform":"win","sha256":"0d240b103bac70b217a6b4cbe1c3989137bbf8ea6dde8bf929f68bfbd13d795d","size":103492,"subdir":"win-64","version":"1.6.8"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-corpcor-1.6.8-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
