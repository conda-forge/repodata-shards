Includes routines that: (1) generate gradient and jacobian matrices (full and banded), (2) find roots of non-linear equations by the 'Newton-Raphson' method,  (3) estimate steady-state conditions of a system of (differential) equations in full, banded or sparse form, using the 'Newton-Raphson' method, or by dynamically running, (4) solve the steady-state conditions for uni-and multicomponent 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D partial differential equations, that have been converted to ordinary differential equations by numerical differencing (using the method-of-lines approach). Includes fortran code.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588597574,"version":"1.7"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-rootsolve-1.7-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*"],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"3ad3558fd40328d0d3216116ed6695dd","name":"r-rootsolve","platform":"win","sha256":"30362632eb5d4a54c8c10585a5898bd57ec80a22c8ab71d38b34d63466ae406c","size":667772,"subdir":"win-64","version":"1.7"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-rootsolve-1.7-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
