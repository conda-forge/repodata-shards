Includes routines that: (1) generate gradient and jacobian matrices (full and banded), (2) find roots of non-linear equations by the 'Newton-Raphson' method,  (3) estimate steady-state conditions of a system of (differential) equations in full, banded or sparse form, using the 'Newton-Raphson' method, or by dynamically running, (4) solve the steady-state conditions for uni-and multicomponent 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D partial differential equations, that have been converted to ordinary differential equations by numerical differencing (using the method-of-lines approach). Includes fortran code.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588597574,"version":"1.7"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-rootsolve-1.7-r3.3.2_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.3.2_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.3.2*"],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"b513beffa78c6a3fbe8105f44ee2b36f","name":"r-rootsolve","platform":"win","sha256":"4ab0b24a2f6ce9ac0f561b4b78e48f90b4eef9e45b4f85f4220265a2043bdd13","size":668112,"subdir":"win-64","version":"1.7"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-rootsolve-1.7-r3.3.2_0.tar.bz2"}
