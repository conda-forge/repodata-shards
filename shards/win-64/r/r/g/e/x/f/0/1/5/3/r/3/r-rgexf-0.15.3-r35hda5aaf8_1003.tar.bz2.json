Using the 'XML' package, it allows the user to easily build/read graph files including attributes, 'GEXF' visual attributes (such as color, size, and position), network dynamics (for both edges and nodes) and edge weighting. Users can build/handle graphs element-by-element or massively through data-frames, visualize the graph on a web browser through 'gexf-js' (a 'javascript' library) and interact with the 'igraph' package.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588579336,"version":"0.15.3"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-rgexf-0.15.3-r35hda5aaf8_1003.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"r35hda5aaf8_1003","build_number":1003,"depends":["m2w64-gcc-libs","r-base >=3.5,<3.6.0a0","r-igraph","r-rook","r-xml"],"license":"GPL (>= 3)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"057d4debe44ff5d76255169c8d59bdfa","name":"r-rgexf","sha256":"32df829aa376c13757243a183ec2b1fbcdd4ee4a74bb068a7e8e4e821b7aee1d","size":588960,"subdir":"win-64","timestamp":1563411516874,"version":"0.15.3"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/r-rgexf-0.15.3-r35hda5aaf8_1003.tar.bz2"}
