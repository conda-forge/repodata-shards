{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small sizes. Common operations on very small arrays are to 3-7 times faster than with NumPy (with NumPy 1.6 it used to be up to 35 times), and 3 times less memory is used to store them. Tinyarrays are useful if you need many small arrays of numbers, and cannot combine them into a few large ones.","dev_url":null,"doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/tinyarray","home":"http://git.kwant-project.org/tinyarray/about/","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"BSD 2-Clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/t/tinyarray/tinyarray-1.2.2.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"Arrays of numbers for Python, optimized for small sizes","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1579465215,"version":"1.2.0a1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"tinyarray-1.2.0a1-py34_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py34_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp34m"],"depends":["python 3.4*"],"license":"BSD 2-Clause","md5":"9c9281dd3fc36770fbebf3e9ca777471","name":"tinyarray","platform":"win","sha256":"28c9f86b1c25a15210b17d875f8953f7f8b391dbfb8a0d4694c119defeaa2a72","size":45156,"subdir":"win-64","version":"1.2.0a1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/tinyarray-1.2.0a1-py34_0.tar.bz2"}
