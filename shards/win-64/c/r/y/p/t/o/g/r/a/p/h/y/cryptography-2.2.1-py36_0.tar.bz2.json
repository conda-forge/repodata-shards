Our goal is for it to be your \"cryptographic standard library\". It supports Python 2.6-2.7, Python 3.3+, and PyPy 2.6+. Cryptography includes both high level recipes, and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests and key derivation functions.","dev_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography","doc_source_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/master/docs/index.rst","doc_url":"http://cryptography.readthedocs.io/","home":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"Apache-2.0 AND BSD-3-Clause AND PSF-2.0","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/c/cryptography/cryptography-3.0.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"Provides cryptographic recipes and primitives to Python developers","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1595349316,"version":"2.2.1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"cryptography-2.2.1-py36_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py36_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp36m"],"depends":["asn1crypto >=0.21.0","cffi >=1.7","idna >=2.1","openssl 1.0.*","python 3.6*","six >=1.4.1"],"license":"Apache 2.0 or BSD 3-Clause, PSF 2","md5":"6c052187acf6b4204f6ee13d300dafeb","name":"cryptography","platform":"win","sha256":"9ee9fb77a752d46f6240eca5db5ab5589f9ac18f0343180730e12c7acb71f82e","size":358265,"subdir":"win-64","version":"2.2.1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/cryptography-2.2.1-py36_0.tar.bz2"}
