{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":false,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"A set of scikit-learn-style transformers for encoding categorical variables into numeric with different techniques. While ordinal, one-hot, and hashing encoders have similar equivalents in the existing scikit-learn version, the transformers in this library all share a few useful properties:  - First-class support for pandas dataframes as an input (and optionally as   output)  - Can explicitly configure which columns in the data are encoded by name or   index, or infer non-numeric columns regardless of input type  - Can drop any columns with very low variance based on training set   optionally  - Portability: train a transformer on data, pickle it, reuse it later and   get the same thing out.  - Full compatibility with sklearn pipelines, input an array-like dataset   like any other transformer","dev_url":null,"doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding","home":"https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/categorical_encoding","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"BSD-3-Clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/c/category_encoders/category_encoders-2.1.0.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"A collection sklearn transformers to encode categorical variables as numeric","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588199692,"version":"1.2.5"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"category_encoders-1.2.5-py36_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py36_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp36m"],"depends":["numpy >=1.8.0","pandas >=0.16.0","patsy >=0.4.0","python 3.6*","scikit-learn >=0.15.0","scipy >=0.9","statsmodels >=0.6.0"],"license":"BSD-3-Clause","license_family":"BSD","md5":"f9e9003a0c3e345c045365eabe95146a","name":"category_encoders","platform":"win","sha256":"2735fb991bac3565b54199415b612c34f23ff4e6530294108f3877e411a5723c","size":37548,"subdir":"win-64","version":"1.2.5"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/category_encoders-1.2.5-py36_0.tar.bz2"}
