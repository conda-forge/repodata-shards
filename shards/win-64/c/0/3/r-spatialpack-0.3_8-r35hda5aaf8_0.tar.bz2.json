    "summary": "Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes. Currently, several methodologies are implemented: A modified t-test to perform hypothesis testing about the independence between the processes, a suitable nonparametric correlation coefficient, the codispersion coefficient, and an F test for assessing the multiple correlation between one spatial process and several others. Functions for image processing and computing the spatial association between images are also provided. SpatialPack gives methods to complement methodologies that are available in geoR for one spatial process.",
