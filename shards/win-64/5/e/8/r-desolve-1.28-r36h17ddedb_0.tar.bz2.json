    "summary": "Functions that solve initial value problems of a system of first-order ordinary differential equations ('ODE'), of partial differential equations ('PDE'), of differential algebraic equations ('DAE'), and of delay differential equations.  The functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar', 'lsode', 'lsodes' of the 'ODEPACK' collection, to the FORTRAN functions 'dvode', 'zvode' and 'daspk' and a C-implementation of solvers of the 'Runge-Kutta' family with fixed or variable time steps.  The package contains routines designed for solving 'ODEs' resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D partial differential equations ('PDE') that have been converted to 'ODEs' by numerical differencing.",
