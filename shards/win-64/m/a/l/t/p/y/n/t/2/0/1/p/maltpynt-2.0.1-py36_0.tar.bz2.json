{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":false,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"The MaLTPyNT (Matteo\u2019s Libraries and Tools in Python for NuSTAR Timing) suite is designed for the quick-look timing analysis of NuSTAR data. It treats properly orbital gaps (e.g., occultation, SAA passages) and performs the standard aperiodic timing analysis (power density spectrum, lags, etc.), plus the cospectrum, a proxy for the power density spectrum that uses the signals from two detectors instead of a single one.","dev_url":"https://bitbucket.org/mbachett/maltpynt","doc_url":"http://maltpynt.readthedocs.org/","home":"https://bitbucket.org/mbachett/maltpynt","license":"BSD 3-clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"run_exports":{},"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/m/maltpynt/maltpynt-2.0.1.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"\"Matteo's library and tools in Python for NuSTAR timing\"","text_prefix":false,"version":"2.0.1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"maltpynt-2.0.1-py36_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py36_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp36m"],"depends":["astropy","matplotlib","numpy","python 3.6*","scipy"],"license":"BSD 3-clause","license_family":"BSD","md5":"67ef1d9fbffe4c4252ca3af2671946fd","name":"maltpynt","platform":"win","sha256":"39539a7eed7fd1264d282740aad5681b6cfa3ae12dfb032c4ec90135dfa66b1e","size":25955276,"subdir":"win-64","version":"2.0.1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/maltpynt-2.0.1-py36_0.tar.bz2"}
