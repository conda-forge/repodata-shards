{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"PolyFEM is a simple C++ and Python finite element library. We provide a wide set of common PDEs including:<br/> - Laplace - Helmholtz - Linear Elasticity - Saint-Venant Elasticity - Neo-Hookean Elasticity - Stokes<br/>  PolyFEM simplicity lies on the interface: just pick a problem, select some boundary condition, and solve. No need to construct complicated function spaces, or learn a new scripting language: everything is set-up trough a the Setting python class. For instance, PolyFEM seamlessly integrates quad/hexes and tri/tets of order up to 4, and integrate state-of-the-art techniques such as the adaptive p-refinement. The library is actively used in our research so expect frequent updates, fixes, and new features!","dev_url":"https://github.com/polyfem/polyfem-python","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://polyfem.github.io/","home":"https://polyfem.github.io/","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"MIT","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://github.com/polyfem/polyfem-python/archive/0.5.2.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"Easy-to-use powerfull finite element library based on Polyfem","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1585059392,"version":"0.4"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"polyfempy-0.4-py36hd0167a9_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"py36hd0167a9_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp36m"],"depends":["libblas >=3.8.0,<4.0a0","libcblas >=3.8.0,<4.0a0","numpy >=1.14.6,<2.0a0","python >=3.6,<3.7.0a0","suitesparse","vc >=14,<15.0a0"],"license":"MIT","license_family":"MIT","md5":"4891e9b009496e09acca9d02147819d4","name":"polyfempy","sha256":"ce9467b8b1ae72d649454ab84d0a6cc8c6874e5b44bb7c2db0f38e806a8deb59","size":3346078,"subdir":"win-64","timestamp":1559142671041,"version":"0.4"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/polyfempy-0.4-py36hd0167a9_0.tar.bz2"}
