{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":false,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"The Materials Knowledge Systems (MKS) is a novel data science approach for solving multiscale materials science problems. It uses techniques from physics, machine learning, regression analysis, signal processing, and spatial statistics to create processing-structure-property relationships. The MKS carries the potential to bridge multiple length scales using localization and homogenization linkages, and provides a data driven framework for solving inverse material design problems. The Materials Knowledge Materials in Python (PyMKS) framework is an object-oriented set of tools and examples, written in Python, that provide high-level access to the MKS framework for rapid creation and analysis of structure-property-processing relationships.","dev_url":"https://github.com/materialsinnovation/pymks/","doc_url":"http://pymks.org/en/latest/rst/README.html","home":"https://github.com/materialsinnovation/pymks/","license":"MIT","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"run_exports":{},"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/p/pymks/pymks-0.3.4.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"The Materials Knowledge System in Python","text_prefix":false,"version":"0.3.4a7"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"pymks-0.3.4a7-py35_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py35_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp35m"],"depends":["nbval","numpy","pytest","pytest-cov","python 3.5*","scikit-learn","scipy","sfepy"],"license":"MIT","license_family":"MIT","md5":"c276f5d6e76a40269a6e87686afa3971","name":"pymks","platform":"win","sha256":"440a68adfc40586da69a8d221c7caccbc81d30235e4351363136e2b00e7b59b1","size":893783,"subdir":"win-64","version":"0.3.4a7"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/pymks-0.3.4a7-py35_0.tar.bz2"}
