    "description": "MeshPy offers quality triangular and tetrahedral mesh generation for Python. Meshes of this type are chiefly used in finite-element simulation codes, but also have many other applications ranging from computer graphics to robotics.  In order to generate 2D and 3D meshes, MeshPy provides Python interfaces to three well-regarded mesh generators, [Triangle](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html) by J. Shewchuk, [TetGen](http://tetgen.berlios.de/) by Hang Si, and [gmsh](http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/) by Christophe Geuzaine and Jean-Francois Remacle. The former two are included in the package in slightly modified versions. A generic mesh reader for the latter is included, as is an easy way to run gmsh from a Python script.  As of Version 0.91.2, MeshPy also works with Python 3.",
