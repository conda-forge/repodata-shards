    "description": "imexam is an affiliated package of AstroPy. It was designed to be a lightweight library which enables users to explore data from a command line interface, through a Jupyter notebook or through a Jupyter console. It can be used with multiple viewers, such as DS9 or Ginga, or without a viewer as a simple library to make plots and grab quick photometry information. It has been designed so that other viewers may be easily attached in the future.",
