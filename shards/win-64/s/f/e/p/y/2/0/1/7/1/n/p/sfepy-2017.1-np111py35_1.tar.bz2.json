{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"SfePy is a software for solving systems of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 1D, 2D and 3D. It can be viewed both as black-box PDE solver, and as a Python package which can be used for building custom applications. The word simple means that complex FEM problems can be coded very easily and rapidly.","dev_url":"https://github.com/sfepy/sfepy","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"http://sfepy.org","home":"http://sfepy.org","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"BSD-3-Clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":"https://github.com/sfepy/sfepy.git","source_url":"https://github.com/sfepy/sfepy/archive/release_2020.2.zip","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"Simple finite elements in Python","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1593695897,"version":"2017.1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"sfepy-2017.1-np111py35_1.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"np111py35_1","build_number":1,"constrains":["pypy <0a0"],"depends":["matplotlib","mpi4py","numpy 1.11*","pyparsing","pytables","python 3.5*","scipy","sympy"],"license":"BSD-3-Clause","license_family":"BSD","md5":"288c7c9790a0026420570c93828f1739","name":"sfepy","platform":"win","sha256":"820702d7a26ef0a3856579f0291a350d6e30088c83f393d28fc53cf003c3432d","size":5775238,"subdir":"win-64","version":"2017.1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/sfepy-2017.1-np111py35_1.tar.bz2"}
