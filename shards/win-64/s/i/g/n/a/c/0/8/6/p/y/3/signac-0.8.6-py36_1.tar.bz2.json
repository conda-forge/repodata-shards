It provides a simple and robust data model to create a well-defined indexable storage layout for data and metadata. This makes it easier to operate on large data spaces, streamlines post-processing and analysis and makes data collectively accessible.","dev_url":"https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://docs.signac.io","home":"https://signac.io","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"BSD 3-Clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://github.com/glotzerlab/signac/archive/v1.4.0.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"Manage large and heterogeneous data spaces on the file system.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1582952464,"version":"0.8.6"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"signac-0.8.6-py36_1.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py36_1","build_number":1,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp36m"],"depends":["bcrypt","passlib","pymongo >=3","python 3.6*"],"license":"BSD 3-Clause","license_family":"BSD","md5":"b1036bac0b477bf27c06f2305524a9f7","name":"signac","platform":"win","sha256":"1020d41d367130a3949f93fa81ef5deff76fc27f483648fd8d770bbece3fd817","size":206104,"subdir":"win-64","version":"0.8.6"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/signac-0.8.6-py36_1.tar.bz2"}
