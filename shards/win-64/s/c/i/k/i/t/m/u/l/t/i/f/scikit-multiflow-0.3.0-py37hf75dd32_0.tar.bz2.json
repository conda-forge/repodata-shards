{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"scikit-multiflow is an open-source machine learning package for streaming data. It extends the scientific tools available in the Python ecosystem. scikit-multiflow is intended for streaming data applications where data is continuously generated and must be processed and analyzed on the go. Data samples are not stored, so learning methods are exposed to new data only once.","dev_url":"https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/scikit-multiflow/","home":"https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"BSD-3-Clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/s/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow-0.5.3.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"A machine learning package for streaming data in Python.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1592375287,"version":"0.3.0"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"scikit-multiflow-0.3.0-py37hf75dd32_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"py37hf75dd32_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp37m"],"depends":["matplotlib >=2.0.0","numpy >=1.11.3,<2.0a0","pandas >=0.21.0","python >=3.7,<3.8.0a0","scikit-learn >=0.20","scipy >1.0.0","sortedcontainers >=1.5.7","vc >=14,<15.0a0"],"license":"BSD-3-Clause","license_family":"BSD","md5":"9dc5211e8dcf84802ca65c9c81a478d6","name":"scikit-multiflow","sha256":"8f7f058b213824ed4d0558080fad5dab4985333d27f52624f8c6dacd5121edd1","size":11833479,"subdir":"win-64","timestamp":1558597952889,"version":"0.3.0"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/scikit-multiflow-0.3.0-py37hf75dd32_0.tar.bz2"}
