These operate directly on in-memory arrays (no FITS files or configuration files). The code is derived from the Source Extractor code base (written in C) and aims to produce results compatible with Source Extractor whenever possible.","dev_url":"https://github.com/kbarbary/sep","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"http://sep.readthedocs.io/","home":"https://github.com/kbarbary/sep","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"LGPL-3.0","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/s/sep/sep-1.0.3.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"Astronomical source extraction and photometry library","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1589059957,"version":"1.0.3"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"sep-1.0.3-py27hc997a72_1.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py27hc997a72_1","build_number":1,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp27m"],"depends":["numpy >=1.11.3,<2.0a0","python >=2.7,<2.8.0a0","vc 9.*"],"license":"LGPL-3.0","license_family":"LGPL","md5":"414e29b51d70421f6c7554a845aae980","name":"sep","platform":"win","sha256":"fd02cc0c15c9a079a3ae5ef176dca23e987815c0be1adbfd91b50dfba6596de1","size":199172,"subdir":"win-64","timestamp":1530387188526,"version":"1.0.3"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/sep-1.0.3-py27hc997a72_1.tar.bz2"}
