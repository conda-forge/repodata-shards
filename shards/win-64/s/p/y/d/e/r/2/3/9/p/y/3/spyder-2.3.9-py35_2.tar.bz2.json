    "description": "Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It features a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection and beautiful visualization capabilities of a scientific package.\\n Furthermore, Spyder offers built-in integration with many popular scientific packages, including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, QtConsole, Matplotlib, SymPy, and more.\\n Beyond its many built-in features, Spyder can be extended even further via third-party plugins.\\n Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing you to build upon its functionality and embed its components, such as the interactive console or advanced editor, in your own software.",
