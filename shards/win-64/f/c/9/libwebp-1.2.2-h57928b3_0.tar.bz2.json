    "description": "WebP is a method of lossy and lossless compression that can be used on a large variety of photographic, translucent and graphical images found on the web. The degree of lossy compression is adjustable so a user can choose the trade-off between file size and image quality. libwebp-base provides the headers and shared libraries. For cwebp and dwep, binaries install libwebp.",
