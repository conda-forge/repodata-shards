    "description": "SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives: to store billions of files! to serve the files fast! Instead of supporting full POSIX file system semantics, SeaweedFS choose to implement only a key~file mapping. Similar to the word \"NoSQL\", you can call it as \"NoFS\".",
