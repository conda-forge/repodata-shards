    "summary": "Implements the 'RUV' (Remove Unwanted Variation) algorithms.  These algorithms attempt to adjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-dimensional data.  The algorithms were originally developed for use with genomic data, especially microarray data, but may be useful with other types of high-dimensional data as well.  These algorithms were proposed by Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012), and by Gagnon-Bartsch, Jacob and Speed (2013).  The algorithms require the user to specify a set of negative control variables, as described in the references.  The algorithms included in this package are 'RUV-2', 'RUV-4', 'RUV-inv', and 'RUV-rinv', along with various supporting algorithms.",
