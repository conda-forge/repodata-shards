    "summary": "C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications A C++ class providing the R interpreter is offered by this package making it easier to have \"R inside\" your C++ application. As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library build of R is required. This works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows provided you use the same tools used to build R itself. d Numerous examples are provided in the eight subdirectories of the examples/ directory of the installed package: standard, 'mpi' (for parallel computing), 'qt' (showing how to embed 'RInside' inside a Qt GUI application), 'wt' (showing how to build a \"web-application\" using the Wt toolkit), 'armadillo' (for 'RInside' use with 'RcppArmadillo') and 'eigen' (for 'RInside' use with 'RcppEigen').  The examples use 'GNUmakefile(s)' with GNU extensions, so a GNU make is required (and will use the 'GNUmakefile' automatically). 'Doxygen'-generated documentation of the C++ classes is available at the 'RInside' website as well.",
