{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":false,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"Nuitka is the Python compiler. It is a seamless replacement or extension to the Python interpreter and compiles every construct that CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 have. It then executes uncompiled code, and compiled code together in an extremely compatible manner.  You can use all Python library modules or and all extension modules freely. It translates the Python into a C level program that then uses \"libpython\" to execute in the same way as CPython does. All optimization is aimed at avoiding overhead, where it's unnecessary. None is aimed at removing compatibility, although slight improvements will occassionally be done, where not every bug of standard Python is emulated, e.g. more complete error messages are given, but there is a full compatibility mode to disable even that.","dev_url":"https://github.com/kayhayen/Nuitka","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"http://nuitka.net/pages/documentation.html","home":"http://nuitka.net","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"Apache 2.0","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/N/Nuitka/Nuitka-0.6.8.4.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"Python compiler with full language support and CPython compatibility","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1592417477,"version":"0.5.29.5"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"nuitka-0.5.29.5-py35_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py35_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp35m"],"depends":["python >=3.5,<3.6.0a0"],"license":"Apache 2.0","md5":"fb95ad2d29abacfe57e17759a1f39f90","name":"nuitka","platform":"win","sha256":"6c06e6c0d91078a1ed22e96cb8227e4a09fd3f08a0edb4e3b00527885679ed0d","size":1996706,"subdir":"win-64","timestamp":1524686699304,"version":"0.5.29.5"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/nuitka-0.5.29.5-py35_0.tar.bz2"}
