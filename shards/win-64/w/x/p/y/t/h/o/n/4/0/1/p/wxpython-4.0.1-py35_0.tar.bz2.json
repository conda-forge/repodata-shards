{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"Welcome to wxPython's Project Phoenix! Phoenix is the improved next-generation wxPython, \"better, stronger, faster than he was before.\" This new implementation is focused on improving speed, maintainability and extensibility. Just like \"Classic\" wxPython, Phoenix wraps the wxWidgets C++ toolkit and provides access to the user interface portions of the wxWidgets API, enabling Python applications to have a native GUI on Windows, Macs or not win systems, with a native look and feel and requiring very little (if any) platform specific code.","dev_url":"https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://docs.wxpython.org/","home":"https://wxpython.org/","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"wxWindows Library v3.1","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/w/wxPython/wxPython-4.0.7.post2.tar.gz","subdirs":["win-64"],"summary":"Cross platform GUI toolkit for Python, \"Phoenix\" version","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1585596857,"version":"4.0.1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"wxpython-4.0.1-py35_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py35_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp35m"],"depends":["python 3.5*","six"],"license":"wxWindows Library v3.1","license_family":"LGPL","md5":"2e6a6ebbb299e186bf79d3ac7647d4d2","name":"wxpython","platform":"win","sha256":"1194115f7c592a55bee7919e7035c19fe3b726ec775c546a5019c2adb210a273","size":16027406,"subdir":"win-64","version":"4.0.1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"win-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/win-64/wxpython-4.0.1-py35_0.tar.bz2"}
