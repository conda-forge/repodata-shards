    "description": "tlx is a collection of C++ helpers and extensions universally needed, but not found in the STL. The most important design goals and conventions are: (i) high modularity with as little dependencies between modules as possible. (ii) attempt to never break existing interfaces. (iii) compile on all platforms with C++ \u2013 smartphones, supercomputers, windows, etc. (iv) zero external dependencies: no additional libraries are required. (v) warning and bug-freeness on all compilers. (vi) keep overhead down \u2013 small overall size such that is can be included without bloating applications.",
