    "description": "Great Expectations is a framework that helps teams save time and promote analytic integrity with a new twist on automated \"testing:\" pipeline tests. Pipeline tests are applied to data (instead of code) and at batch time (instead of compile or deploy time).  Software developers have long known that automated testing is essential for managing complex codebases. Great Expectations brings the same discipline, confidence, and acceleration to data science and engineering teams.",
