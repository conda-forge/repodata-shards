    "summary": "Herein, we provide a broad variety of functions which are useful for handling, manipulating, and visualizing satellite-based remote sensing  data. These operations range from mere data import and layer handling (eg  subsetting), over Raster* typical data wrangling (eg crop, extend), to more  sophisticated (pre-)processing tasks typically applied to satellite imagery  (eg atmospheric and topographic correction). This functionality is  complemented by a full access to the satellite layers' metadata at any  stage and the documentation of performed actions in a separate log file.  Currently available sensors include Landsat 4-5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8  (OLI/TIRS Combined), and additional compatibility is ensured for the Landsat  Global Land Survey data set. Moreover, support for Terra and Aqua-MODIS as  well as PROBA-V is expected to arrive shortly.",
