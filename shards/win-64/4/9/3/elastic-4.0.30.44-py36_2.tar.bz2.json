    "description": "Elastic is a set of python routines for calculation of elastic properties of crystals (elastic constants, equation of state, sound velocities, etc.). It is a third version of the code implemented as a extension to the ASE system. The code was a basis for some of my publications and was described briefly in these papers. The code was available to anyone, presented at the Workshop on ab initio Calculations in Geosciences and used by some of my co-workers.",
