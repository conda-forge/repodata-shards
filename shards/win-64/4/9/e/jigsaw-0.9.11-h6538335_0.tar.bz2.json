    "description": "JIGSAW is a computational library for unstructured mesh generation and tessellation; designed to generate high-quality triangulations and polyhedral decompositions of general planar, surface and volumetric domains. JIGSAW includes refinement-based algorithms for the construction of new meshes, optimisation-driven techniques for the improvement of existing grids, as well as routines to assemble (restricted) Delaunay tessellations and Voronoi complexes.  This package provides the underlying C++ source for JIGSAW; defining a basic command-line interface and a C-format API. A MATLAB / OCTAVE based scripting interface, including a range of additional facilities for file I/O, mesh visualisation and post-processing operations can be found at https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-matlab.",
