    "description": "The space MetPy aims for is GEMPAK (and maybe NCL)-like functionality, in a way that plugs easily into the existing scientific Python ecosystem (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). So, if you take the average GEMPAK script for a weather map, you need to: read data, calculate a derived field, and show on a map/skew-T. One of the benefits hoped to achieve over GEMPAK is to make it easier to use these routines for any meteorological Python application; this means making it easy to pull out the LCL calculation and just use that, or re-use the Skew-T with your own data code. MetPy also prides itself on being well-documented and well-tested, so that on-going maintenance is easily manageable.",
