For discussion of the possibilites of the research flights, the Mission Support System (MSS) was developed. This software helps to review a big amount of metereological and model data by viewing the forecasted parameters of interest along possible regions of a proposed flight path. Data and possible flight paths can be displayed on a hoizontal view (map projection) or on a vertical view (along the proposed flight path). Flight paths can be constructed and modified on these views. Exchange through a waypoint table is also possible.",
