    "description": "GoSpatial is a command-line interface program for analyzing and manipulating geospatial data. It has been developed by John Lindsay using the Go programming language and is compiled to native code. The project is experimental and is intended to provide additional analytical support for the Whitebox Geospatial Analysis Tools open-source GIS software. GoSpatial can however be run completely independent of any other software.",
