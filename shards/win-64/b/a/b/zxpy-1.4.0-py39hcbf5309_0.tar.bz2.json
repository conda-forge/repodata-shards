    "description": "Inspired by Google's zx, but made much simpler and more accessible using  Python. While Bash is cool, and it's extremely powerful when paired with  linux coreutils and pipes. But apart from that, it's a whole another  language to learn, and has a (comparatively) unintuitive syntax for things  like conditionals and loops. zxpy aims to supercharge bash by allowing you  to write scripts in Python, but with native support for bash commands and  pipes.",
