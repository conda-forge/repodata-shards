    "description": "Fast Exact Summation Using Small and Large Superaccumulators (XSUM). XSUM is a library for performing exact summation using super-accumulators. It provides methods for exactly summing a set of floating-point numbers, where using a simple summation and the rounding which happens after each addition could be an important factor in many applications. The main algorithm is taken from the original library [FUNCTIONS FOR EXACT SUMMATION](https://gitlab.com/radfordneal/xsum) described in the paper \"Fast Exact Summation Using Small and Large Superaccumulators,\" by Radford M. Neal.",
