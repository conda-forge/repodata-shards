It is the successor of Brian1 and shares its approach of being highly flexible and easily extensible. It is based on a code generation framework that allows to execute simulations using other programming languages and/or on different devices.", "dev_url": "https://github.com/brian-team/brian2", "doc_source_url": null, "doc_url": "http://brian2.readthedocs.io/", "home": "http://www.briansimulator.org/", "icon_hash": null, "icon_url": null, "identifiers": null, "keywords": null, "license": "CECILL-2.1", "post_link": false, "pre_link": false, "pre_unlink": false, "recipe_origin": null, "run_exports": {}, "source_git_url": null, "source_url": "https://pypi.io/packages/source/B/Brian2/Brian2-2.3.0.2.tar.gz", "subdirs": ["win-64"], "summary": "A clock-driven simulator for spiking neural networks", "tags": null, "text_prefix": false, "timestamp": 1597924825, "version": "2.3.0.2"}}
