    "description": "The greenlet package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython that supports micro-threads called \"tasklets\". Tasklets run pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized with data exchanges on \"channels\".  A \"greenlet\", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of micro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words. This is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs. You can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet; however, it seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to make advanced control flow structures. For example, we can recreate generators; the difference with Python's own generators is that our generators can call nested functions and the nested functions can yield values too. Additionally, you don't need a \"yield\" keyword. See the example in tests/test_generator.py.  Greenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodified interpreter.  Greenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent programming.",
