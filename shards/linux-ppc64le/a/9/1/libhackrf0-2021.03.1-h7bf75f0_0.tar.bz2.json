    "description": "HackRF One from Great Scott Gadgets is a Software Defined Radio peripheral capable of transmission or reception of radio signals from 1 MHz to 6 GHz. Designed to enable test and development of modern and next generation radio technologies, HackRF One is an open source hardware platform that can be used as a USB peripheral or programmed for stand-alone operation. The `libhackrf0` package contains the library for HackRF devices, the `libhackrf` contains the development files for compiling against the HackRF library, and the `hackrf` package contains command line tools for using the devices. For Linux users of `hackrf`, you will likely want to link the provided udev rule into your system installation in order for the hardware to have the correct permissions:      sudo ln -s $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/udev/rules.d/53-hackrf.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/     sudo udevadm control --reload     sudo udevadm trigger  Then, make sure your user account belongs to the plugdev group in order to be able to access your device:      sudo usermod -a -G plugdev <user>  You may have to restart for this change to take effect.",
