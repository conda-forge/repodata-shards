    "description": "The River Avulsion and Floodplain Evolution Model (RAFEM) is a cellular model that simulates river and floodplain morphodynamics over large space and timescales. Cell size is larger than the channel belt width, and natural levees, which maintain a bankfull elevation above the channel bed, exist within a river cell. The river course is determined using a steepest-descent methodology, and erosion and deposition along the river profile are modeled as a linear diffusive process. An avulsion occurs when the riverbed becomes super-elevated relative to the surrounding floodplain, but only if the new steepest-descent path to sea level is shorter than the prior river course. If the new path to sea level is not shorter, then a crevasse splay is deposited in the adjacent river cells. The model has been designed to couple with the Coastline Evolution Model through the CSDMS Basic Model Interface.",
