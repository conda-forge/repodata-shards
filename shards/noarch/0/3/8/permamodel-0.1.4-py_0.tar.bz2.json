    "description": "PermaModel project enables the broader use of permafrost models and consists of several permafrost models representing a range of capability and complexity. The PermaModel provides easy online access to everyone who want to use permafrost models, but lack the expertise and resources to develop them. It includes multiple sets of sample inputs representing a variety of conditions and locations to enable immediate use of any out of three permafrost models. It is built on the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) Modeling Framework platform. CSDMS provides an on-line environment where users can link and run models from multiple Earth science disciplines. We hope that the simple user interfaces, easy online access, open source models, and quick visualization tools can make permafrost models accessible to a broad audience well beyond the permafrost research community. These new easy-to-use modeling tools could be useful to wide-range of users beyond the research community, such as educators, students, and policy-makers.",
