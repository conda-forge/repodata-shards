    "description": "Darr is a Python science library for disk-based NumPy arrays that persist in a format that is simple, self-documented and tool-independent. It enables you to work efficiently with potentially very large arrays, while keeping your data easily accessible from a wide range of computing environments. Self-documentation includes code for reading the array in a variety of current scientific data tools such as Python, R, Julia, IDL, Matlab, Maple, and Mathematica. It is trivially easy to share your data with others or with yourself when working in different computing environments.",
