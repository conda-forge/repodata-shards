    "description": "OpenCensus makes getting critical telemetry out of your services easy and seamless. OpenCensus currently provides libraries for a number of languages that allow you to capture, manipulate, and export metrics and distributed traces to the backend(s) of your choice. OpenCensus works great with all software systems, from client applications, large monoliths, or highly-distributed microservices. OpenCensus started at Google but is now developed by a broad community of service developers, cloud vendors, and community contributors. OpenCensus isn\u2019t tied to any particular vendor\u2019s backend or analysis system. This is OpenCensus for Python.",
