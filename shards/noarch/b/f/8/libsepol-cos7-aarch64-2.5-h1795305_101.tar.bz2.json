    "description": "Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux\u00AE kernel and a number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to improve the security of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement\u00AE, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.  libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies. It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.",
