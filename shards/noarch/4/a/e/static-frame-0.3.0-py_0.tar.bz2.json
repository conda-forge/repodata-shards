    "description": "The StaticFrame library consists of the Series and Frame, immutable data structures for one- and two-dimensional calculations with self-aligning, labelled axes. StaticFrame offers an alternative to Pandas. While many interfaces for data extraction and manipulation are similar to Pandas, StaticFrame deviates from Pandas in many ways: all data is immutable, and all indices must be unique; all vector processing uses NumPy, and the full range of NumPy data types is preserved; the implementation is concise and lightweight; consistent naming and interfaces are used throughout; and flexible approaches to iteration and function application, with built-in options for parallelization, are provided.",
