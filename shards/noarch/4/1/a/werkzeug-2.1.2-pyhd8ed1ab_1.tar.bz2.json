    "description": "**_werkzeug_** German noun: \"tool\". Etymology: *werk* (\"work\"), *zeug* (\"stuff\")  Werkzeug is a comprehensive [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) web application library. It began as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.  It includes:    -   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and       source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any       frame in the stack.   -   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with       headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.   -   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle       streaming data.   -   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs       for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables       from URLs.   -   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user       agents, cookies, files, and more.   -   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications       locally.   -   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without       requiring running a server.  Werkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to choose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle requests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications such as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.  [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while providing more structure and patterns for defining powerful applications.",
