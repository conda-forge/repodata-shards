    "description": "Python Client for Google Cloud Natural Language -------------------------  The [Google Cloud Natural Language](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) API can be used to reveal the structure and meaning of text via powerful machine learning models. You can use it to extract information about people, places, events and much more, mentioned in text documents, news articles or blog posts. You can use it to understand sentiment about your product on social media or parse intent from customer conversations happening in a call center or a messaging app. You can analyze text uploaded in your request or integrate with your document storage on Google Cloud Storage.  - [Client Library Documentation](https://googleapis.dev/python/language/latest/index.html) - [Product Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/language/docs)  **note**      This library currently does not run on Google App Engine Standard.
