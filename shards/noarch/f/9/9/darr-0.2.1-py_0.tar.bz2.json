    "description": "Darr is a Python science library that enables you to work efficiently with disk-based numeric arrays without depending on tool-specific data formats. This makes it easy to share your data with those who do not use Darr or even Python. No exporting required and, as the data is saved in a self-explanatory way, not much explanation required either. Tool-independent and easy access to data is in line with good scientific practice as it promotes wide and long-term availability, to others but also to yourself.",
