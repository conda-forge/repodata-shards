    "description": "JIGSAW is a stand-alone mesh generator written in c++, based on the general-purpose meshing package JIGSAW. This toolbox provides a Python based scripting interface, including file I/O, mesh visualisation and post-processing facilities. The underlying JIGSAW library is a collection of unstructured triangle- and tetrahedron-based meshing algorithms, designed to produce high quality Delaunay-based grids for computational simulation. JIGSAW includes both Delaunay-refinement based algorithms for the construction of new meshes, as well as optimisation driven methods for the improvement of existing grids.",
