    "description": "Writing a setup.py typically involves lots of boilerplate and copy-pasting from project to project. This package aims to simplify that and bring some DRY principle to python packaging. For more information and examples, please refer to: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta. This package is only required to enable the building of Conda Python packages that make use of setupmeta (which is otherwise ordinarily installed dynamically as part of the setup.py workflows).",
