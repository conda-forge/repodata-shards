    "description": "The HistFactory p.d.f. template [CERN-OPEN-2012-016] is per-se independent of its implementation in ROOT and sometimes, it's useful to be able to run statistical analysis outside of ROOT, RooFit, RooStats framework.  This repo is a pure-python implementation of that statistical model for multi-bin histogram-based analysis and its interval estimation is based on the asymptotic formulas of \"Asymptotic formulae for likelihood-based tests of new physics\" [arXiv:1007.1727]. The aim is also to support modern computational graph libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow in order to make use of features such as autodifferentiation and GPU acceleration.",
