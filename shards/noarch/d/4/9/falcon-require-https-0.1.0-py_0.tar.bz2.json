    "description": "The ``falcon-require-https`` package provides a middleware component for sanity-checking that the incoming request was received over HTTPS. While the web server is primarily responsibile for enforcing the HTTPS protocol, misconfiguration is still a leading cause of security vulnerabilities, and so it can be helpful to perform certain additional checks, such as this one, within the application layer itself.",
