    "description": "Darr is a Python science library for working efficiently with potentially large, disk-based numeric arrays and metadata, without depending on tool-specific or complicated data formats. Data is persistent on disk in a self-explanatory way, making it trivially easy to share it and use it in different environments. No need to export anything or to provide much explanation, and no need to assume that a specific tool will be available. Tool-independent and easy access to data is in line with good scientific practice as it promotes wide and long-term availability, to others and to yourself.",
