    "description": "Merlion is a Python library for time series intelligence. It  features a unified interface for many commonly used models and  datasets for anomaly detection and forecasting on both univariate  and multivariate time series, along with standard pre-processing  and post-processing layers. It has several modules to improve  ease-of-use, including visualization, anomaly score calibration to  improve interpetability, AutoML for hyperparameter tuning and model  selection, and model ensembling. Merlion also provides a unique  evaluation framework that simulates the live deployment and  re-training of a model in production. This library aims to provide  engineers and researchers a one-stop solution to rapidly develop  models for their specific time series needs, and benchmark them  across multiple time series datasets.",
