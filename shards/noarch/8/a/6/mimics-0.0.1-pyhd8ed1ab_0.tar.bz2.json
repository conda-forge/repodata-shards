    "description": "Mimic is a tool with the intention to defer actions done on objects or  classes. These actions can then be executed at a later date. It's main  goal is to solve the chicken-and-egg design conundrum, likely attributed to  a sub-optimal project design. Sometimes, though, when working with 3rd  party libraries, you just don't have the choice, and the design of one  library does not mesh with that of another. This library gives control over  \"when\" the user initialized \"what\", while being able to do it in a   controlled local scope without losing the ability to use global   definitions.",
