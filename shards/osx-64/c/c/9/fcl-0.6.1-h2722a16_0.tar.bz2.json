    "description": "FCL is a library for performing three types of proximity queries on a pair of geometric models composed of triangles.  - Collision detection: detecting whether the two models overlap, and   optionally, all of the triangles that overlap. - Distance computation: computing the minimum distance between a pair of   models, i.e., the distance between the closest pair of points. - Tolerance verification: determining whether two models are closer or   farther than a tolerance distance. - Continuous collision detection: detecting whether the two moving   models overlap during the movement, and optionally, the time of   contact. - Contact information: for collision detection and continuous collision   detection, the contact information (including contact normals and   contact points) can be returned optionally.",
