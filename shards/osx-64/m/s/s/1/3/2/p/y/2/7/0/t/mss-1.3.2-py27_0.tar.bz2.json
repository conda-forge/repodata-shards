For discussion of the possibilites of the research flights, the Mission Support System (MSS) was developed. This software helps to review a big amount of metereological and model data by viewing the forecasted parameters of interest along possible regions of a proposed flight path. Data and possible flight paths can be displayed on a hoizontal view (map projection) or on a vertical view (along the proposed flight path). Flight paths can be constructed and modified on these views. Exchange through a waypoint table is also possible.","dev_url":null,"doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":null,"home":"https://bitbucket.org/wxmetvis/mss","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"Apache-2.0","post_link":true,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":true,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://bitbucket.org/wxmetvis/mss/get/1.9.5.tar.gz","subdirs":["osx-64"],"summary":"A QT application and a OGC web server to plan atmospheric research flights.","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1596461719,"version":"1.3.2"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"mss-1.3.2-py27_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py27_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp27m"],"depends":["basemap 1.0.7","chameleon","execnet","hdf4 4.2.12","lxml","netcdf4","paste","pillow","pykml","pyqt 4.11.*","python 2.7*","python-dateutil","pytz","requests","scipy","six","tk 8.5.*"],"license":"Apache 2.0","md5":"a2d177aec0f1eeba01b4df35643a5d5e","name":"mss","platform":"osx","sha256":"ced9caa46c7f16d40bfe7bcfc25031d3fb682936d1b032af383d481e06f226aa","size":496125,"subdir":"osx-64","version":"1.3.2"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"osx-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-64/mss-1.3.2-py27_0.tar.bz2"}
