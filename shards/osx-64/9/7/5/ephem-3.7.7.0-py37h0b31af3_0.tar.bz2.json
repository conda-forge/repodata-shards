    "description": "PyEphem provides an ``ephem`` Python package for performing high-precision astronomy computations. The underlying numeric routines are coded in C and are the same ones that drive the popular `XEphem`_ astronomy application, whose author, Elwood Charles Downey, generously gave permission for their use in PyEphem. The name *ephem* is short for the word *ephemeris*, which is the traditional term for a table giving the position of a planet, asteroid, or comet for a series of dates. The design of PyEphem emphasizes convenience and ease of use. Both celestial bodies and the observer's location on Earth are represented by Python objects, while dates and angles automatically print themselves in standard astronomical formats.",
