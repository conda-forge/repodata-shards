{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"PolyFEM is a simple C++ and Python finite element library. We provide a wide set of common PDEs including:<br/> - Laplace - Helmholtz - Linear Elasticity - Saint-Venant Elasticity - Neo-Hookean Elasticity - Stokes<br/>  PolyFEM simplicity lies on the interface: just pick a problem, select some boundary condition, and solve. No need to construct complicated function spaces, or learn a new scripting language: everything is set-up trough a the Setting python class. For instance, PolyFEM seamlessly integrates quad/hexes and tri/tets of order up to 4, and integrate state-of-the-art techniques such as the adaptive p-refinement. The library is actively used in our research so expect frequent updates, fixes, and new features!","dev_url":"https://github.com/polyfem/polyfem-python","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://polyfem.github.io/","home":"https://polyfem.github.io/","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"MIT","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://github.com/polyfem/polyfem-python/archive/0.5.2.tar.gz","subdirs":["osx-64"],"summary":"Easy-to-use powerfull finite element library based on Polyfem","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1585059392,"version":"0.3"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"polyfempy-0.3-py37h6de7cb9_1.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"py37h6de7cb9_1","build_number":1,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp37m"],"depends":["libblas >=3.8.0,<4.0a0","libcblas >=3.8.0,<4.0a0","libcxx >=4.0.1","numpy >=1.9.1","python >=3.7,<3.8.0a0","suitesparse"],"license":"MIT","license_family":"MIT","md5":"5f1c0789757783f1e36c0e356b0437ee","name":"polyfempy","sha256":"43b9b2ddad9d56b192e5bd5f9604bdea18da449b3cc76d846e5d9265965f67e5","size":4228813,"subdir":"osx-64","timestamp":1557412414223,"version":"0.3"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"osx-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-64/polyfempy-0.3-py37h6de7cb9_1.tar.bz2"}
