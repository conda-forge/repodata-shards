{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":false,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"Pint is a Python package to define, operate and manipulate physical quantities: the product of a numerical value and a unit of measurement. It allows arithmetic operations between them and conversions from and to different units. It is distributed with a comprehensive list of physical units, prefixes and constants. Due to its modular design, you can extend (or even rewrite!) the complete list without changing the source code. It supports a lot of numpy mathematical operations without monkey patching or wrapping numpy.","dev_url":"https://github.com/hgrecco/pint","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"http://pint.readthedocs.org/","home":"https://github.com/hgrecco/pint","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"BSD-3-Clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/P/Pint/Pint-0.14.tar.gz","subdirs":["osx-64"],"summary":"Operate and manipulate physical quantities in Python","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1593715039,"version":"0.7.2"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"pint-0.7.2-py35_2.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py35_2","build_number":2,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp35m"],"depends":["python 3.5*","setuptools"],"license":"BSD 3-Clause","md5":"2aac8519d2f5bff41ddf07e11010f984","name":"pint","platform":"osx","sha256":"88899bea2e2e5886e2174e3871560b098c29e3264de0905e433d06d99c7a7179","size":187818,"subdir":"osx-64","version":"0.7.2"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"osx-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-64/pint-0.7.2-py35_2.tar.bz2"}
