    "description": "Orc is a library and set of tools for compiling and executing very simple programs that operate on arrays of data.  The \"language\" is a generic assembly language that represents many of the features available in SIMD architectures, including saturated addition and subtraction, and many arithmetic operations.  At this point, developers interested in using Orc should look at the examples and try out a few Orc programs in an experimental branch of their own projects.  And provide feedback on how it works.  There will likely be some major changes in ease of use from a developer's perspective over the next few releases.  The 0.4 series of Orc releases will be API and ABI compatible, and will be incompatible with the 0.5 series when it comes out.",
