Py-ART is used by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility for working with data from a number of precipitation and cloud radars, but has been designed so that it can be used by others in the radar and atmospheric communities to examine, process, and analyze data from many types of weather radars.","dev_url":"http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart-docs-travis/dev_reference/index.html","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/","home":"http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"BSD-3-Clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/a/arm_pyart/arm_pyart-1.11.1.tar.gz","subdirs":["osx-64"],"summary":"Python ARM Radar Toolkit","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1584731710,"version":"1.6.0"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"arm_pyart-1.6.0-np19py34_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"np19py34_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["pypy <0a0"],"depends":["matplotlib","netcdf4","numpy 1.9*","python 3.4*","scipy","trmm_rsl"],"license":"BSD","md5":"3b91164bd4c4e1486744fb47f9dcfdd8","name":"arm_pyart","platform":"osx","sha256":"749aca3b0abfb606ab97970e211a2f0428790e36f8c56bc64a9a725f7215a68e","size":2764698,"subdir":"osx-64","version":"1.6.0"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"osx-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-64/arm_pyart-1.6.0-np19py34_0.tar.bz2"}
