    "description": "Genozip  Genozip is also available on Conda. For additional installation options, See: https://genozip.com  Genozip is a compressor for genomic files - while it can compress any file (i.e. not only genomic files), it is optimized to compress FASTQ, BAM, CRAM, VCF, FASTA, GVF, PHYLIP, Chain, Kraken and 23andMe files.  Citing Do you find Genozip useful? Please cite:  Lan, D., et al. (2021) Genozip: a universal extensible genomic data compressor. Bioinformatics, 37, 2225-2230, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab102  Lan, D., et al. (2020) genozip: a fast and efficient compression tool for VCF files Bioinformatics, 36, 4091\u20134092, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa290   Typically, a 2X-5X improvement over the existing compression is achieved when compressing already-compressed files like .fastq.gz .bam vcf.gz and much higher ratios in some other cases.  Yes, Genozip can compress already-compressed files (.gz .bz2 .xz .bam .cram).  The compression is lossless - the decompressed file is 100% identical to the original file (see documentation for exceptions).
