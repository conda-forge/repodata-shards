    "summary": "'Rcpp' integration for 'GNU GSL' vectors and matrices The 'GNU Scientific Library' (or 'GSL') is a collection of numerical routines for scientific computing. It is particularly useful for C and C++ programs as it provides a standard C interface to a wide range of mathematical routines. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite. The 'RcppGSL' package provides an easy-to-use interface between 'GSL' data structures and R using concepts from 'Rcpp' which is itself a package that eases the interfaces between R and C++. This package also serves as a prime example of how to build a package that uses 'Rcpp' to connect to another third-party library. The 'autoconf' script, 'inline' plugin and example package can all be used as a stanza to  write a similar package against another library.",
