{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"OpenMC is a community-developed Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport simulation code. It is capable of performing fixed source, k-eigenvalue, and subcritical multiplication calculations on models built using either a constructive solid geometry or CAD representation. OpenMC supports both continuous-energy and multigroup transport. The continuous-energy particle interaction data is based on a native HDF5 format that can be generated from ACE files produced by NJOY. Parallelism is enabled via a hybrid MPI and OpenMP programming model.","dev_url":"https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://docs.openmc.org","home":"https://openmc.org","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"MIT","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://github.com/mit-crpg/openmc/archive/v0.11.0.tar.gz","subdirs":["osx-64"],"summary":"OpenMC Monte Carlo Code","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1595523657,"version":"0.10.0"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"openmc-0.10.0-py35hb8ecfd0_1.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py35hb8ecfd0_1","build_number":1,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp35m"],"depends":["h5py","hdf5 >=1.10.2,<1.10.3.0a0","libgfortran-ng >=3.0","lxml","matplotlib","numpy >=1.9.3,<2.0a0","pandas","python >=3.5,<3.6.0a0","scipy","six","uncertainties"],"license":"MIT","license_family":"MIT","md5":"bac918b4a3393adec252d5cebce8b181","name":"openmc","platform":"osx","sha256":"6087bd6612806b85b68bc81c22c485e0af891abfade0121c217a29651f7277d1","size":2182499,"subdir":"osx-64","timestamp":1530018929739,"version":"0.10.0"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"osx-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-64/openmc-0.10.0-py35hb8ecfd0_1.tar.bz2"}
