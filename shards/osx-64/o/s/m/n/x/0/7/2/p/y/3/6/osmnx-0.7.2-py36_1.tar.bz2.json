{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":false,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"OSMnx is a Python package that lets you download spatial geometries and model, project, visualize, and analyze real-world street networks from OpenStreetMap's APIs. Users can download and model walkable, drivable, or bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code, and then easily analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily download and work with amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street bearings/orientations, speed/travel time, and network routing.","dev_url":"https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/","home":"https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"MIT","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/o/osmnx/osmnx-0.15.1.tar.gz","subdirs":["osx-64"],"summary":"Python for street networks.
