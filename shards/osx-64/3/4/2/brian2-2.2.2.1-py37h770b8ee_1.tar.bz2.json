    "description": "Brian2 is a simulator for spiking neural networks available on almost all platforms. The motivation for this project is that a simulator should not only save the time of processors, but also the time of scientists.  It is the successor of Brian1 and shares its approach of being highly flexible and easily extensible. It is based on a code generation framework that allows to execute simulations using other programming languages and/or on different devices.",
