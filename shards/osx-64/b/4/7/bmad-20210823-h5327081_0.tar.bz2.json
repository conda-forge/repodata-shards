    "description": "Bmad has been developed at Cornell University's Laboratory for Elementary Particle Physics and has been in use since the mid 1990s. Bmad has a wide range of routines to do many things. Bmad can be used to study both single and multi-particle beam dynamics. It has routines to track both particles and macroparticles. Bmad has various tracking algorithms including Runge-Kutta and symplectic (Lie algebraic) integration. Wakefields, and radiation excitation and damping can be simulated. Bmad has routines for calculating transfer matrices, emittances, Twiss parameters, dispersion, coupling, etc.",
