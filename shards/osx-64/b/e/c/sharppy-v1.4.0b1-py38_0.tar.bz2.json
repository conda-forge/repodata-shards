    "description": "SHARPpy is a collection of open source sounding and hodograph analysis routines, a sounding plotting package, and an interactive, cross-platform application for analyzing real-time soundings all written in Python. It was developed to provide the atmospheric science community a free and consistent source of sounding analysis routines. SHARPpy is updated and vetted by professional meteorologists and climatologists within the scientific community to help maintain a standard source of sounding routines.",
