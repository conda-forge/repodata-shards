The OAuth 1 workflow --------------------  OAuth 1 can seem overly complicated and it sure has its quirks. Luckily, requests_oauthlib hides most of these and let you focus at the task at hand.  Accessing protected resources using requests_oauthlib is as simple as:      >>> from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1Session     >>> twitter = OAuth1Session('client_key',                                 client_secret='client_secret',                                 resource_owner_key='resource_owner_key',                                 resource_owner_secret='resource_owner_secret')     >>> url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1/account/settings.json'     >>> r = twitter.get(url)  Before accessing resources you will need to obtain a few credentials from your provider (e.g. Twitter) and authorization from the user for whom you wish to retrieve resources for. You can read all about this in the full [OAuth 1 workflow guide on RTD](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth1_workflow.html)  The OAuth 2 workflow --------------------  OAuth 2 is generally simpler than OAuth 1 but comes in more flavours. The most common being the Authorization Code Grant, also known as the WebApplication flow.  Fetching a protected resource after obtaining an access token can be extremely simple. However, before accessing resources you will need to obtain a few credentials from your provider (e.g. Google) and authorization from the user for whom you wish to retrieve resources for.
