Includes functions for plotting and inspecting spectra, peak alignment, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal components analysis (PCA) and model-based clustering. Robust methods appropriate for this type of high-dimensional data are available. ChemoSpec is designed for structured experiments, such as metabolomics investigations, where the samples fall into treatment and control groups. Graphical output is formatted consistently for publication quality plots. ChemoSpec is intended to be very user friendly and to help you get usable results quickly. A vignette covering typical operations is available.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588843093,"version":"4.4.97"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-chemospec-4.4.97-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*","r-plyr"],"license":"GPL-3","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"6df4970c90c02a16bf02cb90c26af27f","name":"r-chemospec","platform":"osx","sha256":"7fc5636b5e6d310f1c2c3dcca0ca101b9528c097fd83956564e91f425731be51","size":2878739,"subdir":"osx-64","version":"4.4.97"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"osx-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-64/r-chemospec-4.4.97-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
