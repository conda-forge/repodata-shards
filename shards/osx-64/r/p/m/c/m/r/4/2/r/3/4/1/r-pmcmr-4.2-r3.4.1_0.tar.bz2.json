The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained, but kept for compatibility of reverse depending packages for some time.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588568115,"version":"4.2"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-pmcmr-4.2-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*"],"license":"GPL (>= 3)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"f83cccff392a9be9d5910bc19017f855","name":"r-pmcmr","platform":"osx","sha256":"f067ed7cf865a872523ed190678e9e3bee5f26c55cbb524fc422bc3dea9bdec5","size":431513,"subdir":"osx-64","version":"4.2"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"osx-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-64/r-pmcmr-4.2-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
