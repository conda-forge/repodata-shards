These algorithms attempt to adjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-dimensional data.  The algorithms were originally developed for use with genomic data, especially microarray data, but may be useful with other types of high-dimensional data as well.  These algorithms were proposed in Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433>, Gagnon-Bartsch, Jacob and Speed (2013), and Molania, et. al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkz433>.  The algorithms require the user to specify a set of negative control variables, as described in the references.  The algorithms included in this package are 'RUV-2', 'RUV-4', 'RUV-inv', 'RUV-rinv', 'RUV-I', and RUV-III', along with various supporting algorithms.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588744840,"version":"0.9.6"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-ruv-0.9.6-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["libgcc","r-base 3.4.1*"],"license":"GPL","license_family":"GPL","md5":"ad7deaa1b15363d7a4cb4975afbb75b5","name":"r-ruv","platform":"osx","sha256":"6a75f1520ac7319f2345e69f21e2d83d1deef62f59cf53a84509b5551335d0a2","size":78943,"subdir":"osx-64","version":"0.9.6"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"osx-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/osx-64/r-ruv-0.9.6-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
