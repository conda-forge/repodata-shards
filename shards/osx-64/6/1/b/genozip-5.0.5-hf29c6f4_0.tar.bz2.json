    "description": "genozip genozip is a compressor for genomic files - it compresses VCF/BCF, SAM/BAM, fastq, fasta, GVF and 23andMe files. If can even compress them if they are already compressed with .gz .bz2 .xz (for full list of supported file types see 'genozip --input --help').  It achieves x2 to x5 better compression ratios than gzip because it leverages some properties specific to genomic data to compress better. It is also a lot faster than gzip.  The compression is lossless - the decompressed file is 100% identical to the original file.  The command line options are similar to gzip and bcftools, so if you're familiar with these, it works pretty much the same. To get started, try: genozip --help  Commands: genozip   - compress one or more files genounzip - decompress one or more files genols    - show metadata of one or more files or the entire directory genocat   - view one or more files  Some advanced options:  Lookups: genocat -r ^Y,MT file1.vcf       -- displays all chromosomes except Y and MT genocat -r -10000 file1.vcf      -- displays positions up to 10000 genocat -s SMPL1,SMPL2 file1.vcf -- displays 2 samples Note: there is no need for a separate indexing step or index file  Concatenating & splitting: genozip file1.vcf file2.vcf -o concat.vcf.genozip genounzip concat.vcf.genozip -O  Calculating the MD5: genozip file.vcf --md5  Encryption: genozip file.vcf --password abc  Even better compression, with some minor modifications of the data: genozip file.vcf --optimize  Compress and then verify that the compressed file decompresses correctly: genozip file.vcf --test  Do you find genozip to be helpful in your research?
