    "description": "climlab-emanuel-convection makes the Emanuel convection code callable from Python by wrapping using f2py. This is a lightweight wrapper that emulates the Fortran interface as closely as possible. The primary use case is to drive the convection process in climlab, but it can be used as a standalone driver if you are familiar with the Fortran interface.",
