    "description": "The original goal of this project was to have a very fast, efficient, and accurate SQL parser I could use for building data lineage graphs across large code bases (think hundreds of auto-generated .sql files). Most existing sql parsing approaches for python are either very slow or not accurate (especially in regards to deeply nested queries, sub-selects and/or table aliases). Looking to the rust community for support, I found the excellent sqlparser-rs crate which is quite easy to wrap in python code.",
