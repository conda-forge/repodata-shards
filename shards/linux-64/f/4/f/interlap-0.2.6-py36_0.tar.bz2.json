    "description": "InterLap: simple, fast interval overlap testing InterLap is >20 times faster than doing a naive search (see: https://brentp.github.io/interlap/benchmark.html) with **no memory overhead** because it operates on a sorted list. It is pure python and has no dependencies.  It uses binary search and a knowledge of the longest observed interval to quickly query datasets with 100's of thousands of intervals.",
