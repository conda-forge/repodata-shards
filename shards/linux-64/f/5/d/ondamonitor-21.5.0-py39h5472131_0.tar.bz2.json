    "description": "OM (OnDA Monitor) is a framework for the development of programs that can monitor x-ray imaging experiments in real-time. It is also a set of ready-to-use monitoring programs. It is the spiritual successor of the OnDA Project and it is maintained mostly by the same team of developers. OM offers a set of stable and efficient real-time monitoring programs for the most common types of x-ray imaging experiments. These can be used immediately without modifications or can be easily adapted to meet the users\u2019 requirements. In addition, the project provides a set of modules that can be used to easily develop other monitoring programs, tailored to the characteristics of specific experiments.",
