    "description": "The cysgp4 package is a Cython-powered wrapper of the sgp4 C++ library by Daniel Warner to compute satellite positions from two-line elements (TLE). It provides similar functionality as the well-known sgp4 Python package by Brandon Rhodes, which uses Numba internally to speed-up the calculations. In contrast to sgp4, cysgp4 can work well with arrays of TLEs and/or times and make use of multi-core platforms (via OpenMP) to boost processing times a lot.",
