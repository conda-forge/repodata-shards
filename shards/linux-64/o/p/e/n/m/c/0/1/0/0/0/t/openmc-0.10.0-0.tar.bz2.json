{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"OpenMC is a community-developed Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport simulation code. It is capable of performing fixed source, k-eigenvalue, and subcritical multiplication calculations on models built using either a constructive solid geometry or CAD representation. OpenMC supports both continuous-energy and multigroup transport. The continuous-energy particle interaction data is based on a native HDF5 format that can be generated from ACE files produced by NJOY. Parallelism is enabled via a hybrid MPI and OpenMP programming model.","dev_url":"https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://docs.openmc.org","home":"https://openmc.org","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"MIT","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://github.com/mit-crpg/openmc/archive/v0.11.0.tar.gz","subdirs":["linux-64"],"summary":"OpenMC Monte Carlo Code","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1595523657,"version":"0.10.0"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"openmc-0.10.0-0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"0","build_number":0,"constrains":["pypy <0a0"],"depends":["h5py","hdf5 1.8.18|1.8.18.*","libgcc","libgfortran","lxml","matplotlib","numpy >=1.9","pandas","python >=2.7","scipy","six","uncertainties"],"license":"MIT","license_family":"MIT","md5":"7893cd06cf171819cb0ae5e5a42d00ad","name":"openmc","platform":"linux","sha256":"1712a0c6fa9c76332a2098d1e9c6a2eab649c4b1ea823cbda53e2f9232a7de2c","size":2415931,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"0.10.0"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/openmc-0.10.0-0.tar.bz2"}
