    "description": "Fakeroot-ng is a clean re-implementation of fakeroot. The core idea is to run a program, but wrap all system calls that program performs so that it thinks it is running as root, while it is, in practice, running as an unprivileged user. When the program is trying to perform a privileged operation (such as modifying a file's owner or creating a block device), this operation is emulated, so that an unprivileged operation is actually carried out, but the result of the privileged operation is reported to the program whenever it attempts to query the result.",
