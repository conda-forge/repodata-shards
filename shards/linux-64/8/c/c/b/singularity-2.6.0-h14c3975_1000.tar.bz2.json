    "description": "Singularity is a container platform focused on supporting \"Mobility of Compute\"  Mobility of Compute encapsulates the development to compute model where developers can work in an environment of their choosing and creation and when the developer needs additional compute resources, this environment can easily be copied and executed on other platforms. Additionally as the primary use case for Singularity is targeted towards computational portability, many of the barriers to entry of other container solutions do not apply to Singularity making it an ideal solution for users (both computational and non-computational) and HPC centers.",
