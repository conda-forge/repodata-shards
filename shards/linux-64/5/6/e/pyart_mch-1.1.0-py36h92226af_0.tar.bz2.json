    "description": "This is the MeteoSwiss version of Py-ART. Py-ART, is an open source Python module containing a growing collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities build on top of the Scientific Python stack and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. Py-ART is used by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility for working with data from a number of precipitation and cloud radars, but has been designed so that it can be used by others in the radar and atmospheric communities to examine, process, and analyze data from many types of weather radars. The MeteoSwiss version contains enhanced and experimental functionality. MeteoSwiss regularly contributes back to the ARM-DOE Py-ART.",
