    "summary": "The Kruskal and Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks  or van der Waerden's normal score test can be employed,  if the data do not meet the assumptions  for one-way ANOVA. Provided that significant differences  were detected by the omnibus test, one may be interested  in applying post-hoc tests for pairwise multiple comparisons  (such as Nemenyi's test, Dunn's test, Conover's test, van der Waerden's test). Similarly, one-way ANOVA with repeated  measures that is also referred to as ANOVA with unreplicated  block design can also be conducted via the Friedman-Test  or the Quade-test. The consequent post-hoc pairwise  multiple comparison tests according to Nemenyi, Conover and Quade are also provided in this package. Finally Durbin's test for  a two-way balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) is also given in this package.",
