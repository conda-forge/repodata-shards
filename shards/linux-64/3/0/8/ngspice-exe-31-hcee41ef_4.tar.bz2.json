    "description": "ngspice is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits.  Such a circuit may comprise of JFETs, bipolar and MOS transistors, passive elements like R, L, or C, diodes, transmission lines and other devices, all interconnected in a netlist. Digital circuits are simulated as well, event driven and fast, from single gates to complex circuits. And you may enter the combination of both analog and digital as a mixed-signal circuit.  ngspice offers a wealth of device models for active, passive, analog, and digital elements. Model parameters are provided by the semiconductor manufacturers. The user add her circuits as a netlist, and the output is one or more graphs of currents, voltages and other electrical quantities or is saved in a data file.  Note:   This build was configured with `--enable-xspice --enable-cider --enable=openmp`   See the [build script](https://git.io/JfVZX) for more specifics.",
