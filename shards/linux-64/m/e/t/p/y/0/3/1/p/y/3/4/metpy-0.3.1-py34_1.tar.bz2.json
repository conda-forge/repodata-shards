{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":false,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"The space MetPy aims for is GEMPAK (and maybe NCL)-like functionality, in a way that plugs easily into the existing scientific Python ecosystem (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). So, if you take the average GEMPAK script for a weather map, you need to: read data, calculate a derived field, and show on a map/skew-T. One of the benefits hoped to achieve over GEMPAK is to make it easier to use these routines for any meteorological Python application; this means making it easy to pull out the LCL calculation and just use that, or re-use the Skew-T with your own data code. MetPy also prides itself on being well-documented and well-tested, so that on-going maintenance is easily manageable.","dev_url":"https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://unidata.github.io/MetPy","home":"https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"BSD-3-Clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/M/MetPy/MetPy-0.12.2.tar.gz","subdirs":["linux-64"],"summary":"MetPy is a collection of tools in Python for reading, visualizing and performing calculations with weather data.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1596751098,"version":"0.3.1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"metpy-0.3.1-py34_1.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py34_1","build_number":1,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp34m"],"depends":["matplotlib >=1.4.0","numpy >=1.8.0","pint >=0.6","python 3.4*","scipy >=0.13.3"],"license":"BSD 3-Clause","md5":"c08aace05119ee13c24cfdec6067107e","name":"metpy","platform":"linux","sha256":"9c7cd4941bf6ed8b02dacf386c2cf085a7ba8eb9fa3af38b519a67677b9e4e9d","size":164581,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"0.3.1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/metpy-0.3.1-py34_1.tar.bz2"}
