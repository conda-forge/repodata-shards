    "description": "Genozip  Genozip is also available on Conda and binary downloads. For additional installation options, See: https://genozip.com  Genozip is a compressor for BAM, FASTQ, VCF and other genomic files - see https://genozip.com  For Illumina data .bam and .fastq.gz files, the typical gain over gzip is around 4X. For PacBio and Oxford Nanopore data aligned .bam files, the gain is typically around 2X. For .vcf.gz files, the gain over gzip is typically 3-6X. Here are some examples: https://genozip.com/benchmarks.html.  Yes, Genozip can compress already-compressed files (.gz .bz2 .xz .bam .cram).  The compression is lossless - the decompressed file is 100% identical to the original file (see documentation for exceptions).
