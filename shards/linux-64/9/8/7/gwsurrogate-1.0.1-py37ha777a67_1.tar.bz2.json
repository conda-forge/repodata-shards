    "description": "GWSurrogate is an easy to use interface to gravitational wave surrogate models.  Surrogates provide a fast and accurate evaluation mechanism for gravitational waveforms which would otherwise be found through solving differential equations. These equations must be solved in the 'building' phase, which was performed using other codes.",
