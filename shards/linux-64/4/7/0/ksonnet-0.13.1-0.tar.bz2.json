    "description": "ksonnet is a framework for writing, sharing, and deploying Kubernetes application manifests. With its CLI, you can generate a complete application from scratch in only a few commands, or manage a complex system at scale. Specifically, ksonnet allows you to: * Reuse common manifest patterns (within your app or from external libraries) * Customize manifests directly with powerful object concatenation syntax * Deploy app manifests to multiple environments * Diff across environments to compare two running versions of your app Track the entire state of your app configuration in version controllable files All of this results in a more iterative process for developing manifests, one that can be supplemented by continuous integration (CI).",
