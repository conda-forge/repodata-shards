    "description": "`JIGSAW` is an unstructured mesh generator and tessellation library; designed to generate high-quality triangulations and polyhedral decompositions of general planar, surface and volumetric domains. `JIGSAW` includes refinement-based algorithms for the construction of new meshes, optimisation-driven techniques for the improvement of existing grids, as well as routines to assemble (restricted) Delaunay tessellations, Voronoi complexes and Power diagrams.  This package provides the underlying `c++` source for `JIGSAW`; defining a basic command-line interface and a `c`-format `API`. Higher-level scripting interfaces, supporting a range of additional facilities for file I/O, mesh visualisation and post-processing operations are also available, including for `MATLAB` / `OCTAVE` (https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-matlab) and for `PYTHON` (https://github.com/dengwirda/jigsaw-python).",
