    "description": "9/Aug/2021 MASTER IS CURRENTLY BROKEN, PLEASE INSTALL FROM https://github.com/divonlan/genozip/releases/latest  Genozip  (available on Conda, Docker Hub See: https://genozip.com)  Genozip is a compressor for genomic files - while it can compress any file (i.e. not only genomic files), it is optimized to compress FASTQ, SAM/BAM/CRAM, VCF/BCF, FASTA, GVF, PHYLIP, Chain, Kraken and 23andMe files.  Citing Do you find Genozip useful? Please cite: Lan, D., et al. (2021) Genozip: a universal extensible genomic data compressor. Bioinformatics, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab102 Lan, D., et al. (2020) genozip: a fast and efficient compression tool for VCF files Bioinformatics, 36, 4091\u20134092, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa290   Typically, a 2X-5X improvement over the existing compression is achieved when compressing already-compressed files like .fastq.gz .bam vcf.gz and much higher ratios in some other cases.  Yes, Genozip can compress already-compressed files (.gz .bz2 .xz .bam .cram).  The compression is lossless - the decompressed file is 100% identical to the original file (see documentation for exceptions).
