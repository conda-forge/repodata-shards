{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for small sizes. Common operations on very small arrays are to 3-7 times faster than with NumPy (with NumPy 1.6 it used to be up to 35 times), and 3 times less memory is used to store them. Tinyarrays are useful if you need many small arrays of numbers, and cannot combine them into a few large ones.","dev_url":null,"doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://gitlab.kwant-project.org/kwant/tinyarray","home":"http://git.kwant-project.org/tinyarray/about/","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"BSD 2-Clause","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/t/tinyarray/tinyarray-1.2.2.tar.gz","subdirs":["linux-64"],"summary":"Arrays of numbers for Python, optimized for small sizes","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1579465215,"version":"1.2.0a1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"tinyarray-1.2.0a1-py36_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py36_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp36m"],"depends":["python 3.6*"],"license":"BSD 2-Clause","md5":"94d68de03b28d139c60bc4ffeeb2dbf1","name":"tinyarray","platform":"linux","sha256":"0025d6eb29640f38a3b39890aa0eaf40d3e4508aa929f0547b6d1e0db083907f","size":254565,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"1.2.0a1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/tinyarray-1.2.0a1-py36_0.tar.bz2"}
