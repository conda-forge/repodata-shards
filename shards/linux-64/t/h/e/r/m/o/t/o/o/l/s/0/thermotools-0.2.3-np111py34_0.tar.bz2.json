{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"The thermotools package is a lowlevel implementation toolbox for the analyis of multi-ensemble calculations. It contains estimators for the state-continuous transition-based reweighting analysis method (TRAM) and its state-discrete variant (dTRAM), Bennet acceptance ratio (BAR) and its multi-state variant (MBAR), and the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM). While you can use thermotools on its own, we recommend to use it in combination with PyEMMA.","dev_url":"https://github.com/markovmodel/thermotools","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":null,"home":"http://github.com/markovmodel/thermotools","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"LGPL3+","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/t/thermotools/thermotools-0.2.7.tar.gz","subdirs":["linux-64"],"summary":"Lowlevel implementation of (transition-based and histogram) reweighting analyis methods for Python.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1542131555,"version":"0.2.3"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"thermotools-0.2.3-np111py34_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"np111py34_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["pypy <0a0"],"depends":["msmtools >=1.1.4","numpy 1.11*","python 3.4*","scipy"],"license":"LGPL","md5":"c7c87476694ef7dbd2d64c68befd3cf3","name":"thermotools","platform":"linux","sha256":"739c47841b49d85766e55afa0bd2eb855f4214495e222b2b226125ecb031e2be","size":2424918,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"0.2.3"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/thermotools-0.2.3-np111py34_0.tar.bz2"}
