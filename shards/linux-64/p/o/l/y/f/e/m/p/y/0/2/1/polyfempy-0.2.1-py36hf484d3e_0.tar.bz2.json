{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"PolyFEM is a simple C++ and Python finite element library. We provide a wide set of common PDEs including:<br/> - Laplace - Helmholtz - Linear Elasticity - Saint-Venant Elasticity - Neo-Hookean Elasticity - Stokes<br/>  PolyFEM simplicity lies on the interface: just pick a problem, select some boundary condition, and solve. No need to construct complicated function spaces, or learn a new scripting language: everything is set-up trough a the Setting python class. For instance, PolyFEM seamlessly integrates quad/hexes and tri/tets of order up to 4, and integrate state-of-the-art techniques such as the adaptive p-refinement. The library is actively used in our research so expect frequent updates, fixes, and new features!","dev_url":"https://github.com/polyfem/polyfem-python","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://polyfem.github.io/","home":"https://polyfem.github.io/","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"MIT","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://github.com/polyfem/polyfem-python/archive/0.5.2.tar.gz","subdirs":["linux-64"],"summary":"Easy-to-use powerfull finite element library based on Polyfem","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1585059392,"version":"0.2.1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"polyfempy-0.2.1-py36hf484d3e_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"py36hf484d3e_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp36m"],"depends":["libgcc-ng >=7.3.0","libstdcxx-ng >=7.3.0","numpy >=1.9.1","python >=3.6,<3.7.0a0"],"license":"MIT","license_family":"MIT","md5":"b5616826b03b0627060414d3557f06cd","name":"polyfempy","sha256":"2132e9a3486f4d98bb341e81519cb9ae979cb9a77226a9f0d4c86b54b1efcb05","size":5009339,"subdir":"linux-64","timestamp":1550620613072,"version":"0.2.1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/polyfempy-0.2.1-py36hf484d3e_0.tar.bz2"}
