{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"A Python extension written in C for fast computation of: Levenshtein (edit) distance and edit sequence manipulation; string similarity; approximate median strings, and generally string averaging; string sequence and set similarity. Levenshtein has a some overlap with difflib (SequenceMatcher). It supports only strings, not arbitrary sequence types, but on the other hand it's much faster.","dev_url":"http://github.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein","doc_source_url":null,"doc_url":"https://rawgit.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein/master/docs/Levenshtein.html","home":"http://github.com/ztane/python-Levenshtein","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"GPL-2.0","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/p/python-levenshtein/python-Levenshtein-0.12.0.tar.gz","subdirs":["linux-64"],"summary":"Python extension for computing string edit distances and similarities.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1597184753,"version":"0.12.0"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"python-levenshtein-0.12.0-py35_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"py35_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp35m"],"depends":["python 3.5*"],"license":"GPL 2.0","md5":"18529b74a6acfbcfe094da5c3fb283d5","name":"python-levenshtein","platform":"linux","sha256":"0bd959b56b474b8a3994ab193f51f30e41821fa070e4c9e01f9007f5b02f7de9","size":144216,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"0.12.0"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/python-levenshtein-0.12.0-py35_0.tar.bz2"}
