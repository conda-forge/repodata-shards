While global measures such as accuracy are useful, they cannot be used for explaining why a model made a specific prediction. 'lime' (a port of the 'lime' 'Python' package) is a method for explaining the outcome of black box models by fitting a local model around the point in question an perturbations of this point. The approach is described in more detail in the article by Ribeiro et al.
