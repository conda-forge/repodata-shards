The random effects can have a general form, of which familial interactions (a \"kinship\" matrix) is a particular special case.  Note that the simplest case of a mixed effects Cox model, i.e. a single random  per-group intercept, is also called a \"frailty\" model.  The approach is based on Rippatti and Palgren, Biometrics 2002.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588832072,"version":"2.2_10"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-coxme-2.2_10-r35hcdcec82_1.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"r35hcdcec82_1","build_number":1,"depends":["libgcc-ng >=7.3.0","r-base >=3.5,<3.6.0a0","r-bdsmatrix >=1.3","r-matrix >=1.0","r-nlme","r-survival >=2.36.14"],"license":"LGPL-2","license_family":"LGPL","md5":"899c3f8c41d4b19a45a584eed5fd79bb","name":"r-coxme","sha256":"d7d8bc5e69275a6597fb2ec6e0f1698906ebeca7b242b3edc63fa753af23d361","size":1205704,"subdir":"linux-64","timestamp":1563720761589,"version":"2.2_10"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/r-coxme-2.2_10-r35hcdcec82_1.tar.bz2"}
