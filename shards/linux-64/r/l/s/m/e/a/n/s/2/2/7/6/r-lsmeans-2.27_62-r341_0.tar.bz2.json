Compute contrasts or linear functions of  least-squares means, and comparisons of slopes.  Plots and compact letter displays. Least-squares means were proposed in Harvey, W (1960) \"Least-squares analysis of data with unequal subclass numbers\", Tech Report ARS-20-8, USDA National Agricultural Library, and discussed further in Searle, Speed, and Milliken (1980) \"Population marginal means  in the linear model: An alternative to least squares means\",  The American Statistician 34(4), 216-221 <doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031>. NOTE: lsmeans now relies primarily on code in the 'emmeans' package. 'lsmeans' will be archived in the near future.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588774052,"version":"2.27_62"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-lsmeans-2.27_62-r341_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"r341_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base >=3.4.1,<3.4.2.0a0","r-coda >=0.17","r-estimability","r-multcomp","r-mvtnorm","r-nlme","r-plyr","r-xtable >=1.8_2"],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"8433cef0f345ead499f9d88a0b3d2daa","name":"r-lsmeans","sha256":"53df8ce31aea7dd9626eb572af81459601c4afd07e1d991e2655a4e7b24da8fa","size":1099514,"subdir":"linux-64","timestamp":1539004158952,"version":"2.27_62"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/r-lsmeans-2.27_62-r341_0.tar.bz2"}
