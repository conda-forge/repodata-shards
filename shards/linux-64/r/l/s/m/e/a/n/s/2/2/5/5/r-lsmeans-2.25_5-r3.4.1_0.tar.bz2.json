Compute contrasts or linear functions of  least-squares means, and comparisons of slopes.  Plots and compact letter displays. Least-squares means were proposed in Harvey, W (1960) \"Least-squares analysis of data with unequal subclass numbers\", Tech Report ARS-20-8, USDA National Agricultural Library, and discussed further in Searle, Speed, and Milliken (1980) \"Population marginal means  in the linear model: An alternative to least squares means\",  The American Statistician 34(4), 216-221 <doi:10.1080/00031305.1980.10483031>. NOTE: lsmeans now relies primarily on code in the 'emmeans' package. 'lsmeans' will be archived in the near future.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588774052,"version":"2.25_5"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-lsmeans-2.25_5-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*","r-coda >=0.17","r-estimability","r-multcomp","r-mvtnorm","r-nlme","r-plyr","r-xtable >=1.8_2"],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"7f6f0c9018ed5a0195a16af53cd5c21a","name":"r-lsmeans","platform":"linux","sha256":"8d2ed985bb31d0d192f20227362edbfe3be6c50b8676de49f0b3f2438ebd34c2","size":1297100,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"2.25_5"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/r-lsmeans-2.25_5-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
