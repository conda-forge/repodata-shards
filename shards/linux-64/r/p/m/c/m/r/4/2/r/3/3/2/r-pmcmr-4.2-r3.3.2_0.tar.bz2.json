The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained, but kept for compatibility of reverse depending packages for some time.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588568115,"version":"4.2"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-pmcmr-4.2-r3.3.2_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.3.2_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.3.2*"],"license":"GPL (>= 3)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"5eda2f9d74c68a386ca2680b2f31fb50","name":"r-pmcmr","platform":"linux","sha256":"32e68ce8eb6355259efd7d2246b361c526c617a775ce3c4da8046cd402e987fa","size":431239,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"4.2"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/r-pmcmr-4.2-r3.3.2_0.tar.bz2"}
