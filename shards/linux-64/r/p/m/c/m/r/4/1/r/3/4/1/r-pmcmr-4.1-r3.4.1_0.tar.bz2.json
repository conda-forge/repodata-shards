The 'PMCMR' package is no longer maintained, but kept for compatibility of reverse depending packages for some time.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588568115,"version":"4.1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-pmcmr-4.1-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*"],"license":"GPL (>= 3)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"7ef158d34632fa1f44550dcb73ef8027","name":"r-pmcmr","platform":"linux","sha256":"b0410d6b78735eddf6cf47010ef7634acc681a5817b521046de276539c888b82","size":405208,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"4.1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/r-pmcmr-4.1-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
