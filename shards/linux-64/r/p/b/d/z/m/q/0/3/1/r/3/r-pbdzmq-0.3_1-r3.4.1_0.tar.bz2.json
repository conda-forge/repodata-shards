This package provides high level R wrapper functions to easily utilize 'ZeroMQ'. We mainly focus on interactive client/server programming frameworks. For convenience, a minimal 'ZeroMQ' library (4.2.2) is shipped with 'pbdZMQ', which can be used if no system installation of 'ZeroMQ' is available.  A few wrapper functions compatible with 'rzmq' are also provided.","tags":null,"text_prefix":true,"timestamp":1588566086,"version":"0.3_1"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-pbdzmq-0.3_1-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*","r-r6","zeromq 4.1.*"],"license":"GPL-3.0","md5":"3bb175c2c293fd03a91116a9a3eeeaea","name":"r-pbdzmq","platform":"linux","sha256":"83eff41ea2557639a204a464cd6b03e84bd3bfdf2fe6033ef745dfc7264dbc88","size":348557,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"0.3_1"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/r-pbdzmq-0.3_1-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
