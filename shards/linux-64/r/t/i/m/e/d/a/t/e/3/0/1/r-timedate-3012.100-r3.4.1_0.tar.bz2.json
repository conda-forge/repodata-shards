Beyond these standards it provides the \"Financial Center\" concept which allows to handle data records collected in different time  zones and mix them up to have always the proper time stamps with  respect to your personal financial center, or alternatively to the GMT reference time. It can thus also handle time stamps from historical  data records from the same time zone, even if the financial  centers changed day light saving times at different calendar dates.","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1588538062,"version":"3012.100"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"r-timedate-3012.100-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"arch":"x86_64","build":"r3.4.1_0","build_number":0,"depends":["r-base 3.4.1*"],"license":"GPL (>= 2)","license_family":"GPL3","md5":"f4fde36c1f4b3bebe514e275e95f8366","name":"r-timedate","platform":"linux","sha256":"b34fea9134a2e2cfdef07630232f0b60d3a17cc67254f54d9cb8264835538a75","size":849746,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"3012.100"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/r-timedate-3012.100-r3.4.1_0.tar.bz2"}
