    "summary": "The 'Rcpp' package provides R functions as well as C++ classes which offer a seamless integration of R and C++. Many R data types and objects can be mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing of new code as well as easier integration of third-party libraries. Documentation  about 'Rcpp' is provided by several vignettes included in this package, via the  'Rcpp Gallery' site at <http://gallery.rcpp.org>, the paper by Eddelbuettel and  Francois (2011, JSS), and the book by Eddelbuettel (2013, Springer); see  'citation(\"Rcpp\")' for details on these last two.",
