{"channeldata":{"activate.d":false,"binary_prefix":true,"deactivate.d":false,"description":"Arrow is a Python library that offers a sensible, human-friendly approach to creating, manipulating, formatting and converting dates, times, and timestamps. It implements and updates the datetime type, plugging gaps in functionality, and provides an intelligent module API that supports many common creation scenarios. Simply put, it helps you work with dates and times with fewer imports and a lot less code.","dev_url":"https://github.com/crsmithdev/arrow","doc_source_url":"https://github.com/crsmithdev/arrow/tree/master/docs","doc_url":"https://arrow.readthedocs.io","home":"https://github.com/crsmithdev/arrow","icon_hash":null,"icon_url":null,"identifiers":null,"keywords":null,"license":"Apache-2.0","post_link":false,"pre_link":false,"pre_unlink":false,"recipe_origin":null,"run_exports":{},"source_git_url":null,"source_url":"https://pypi.io/packages/source/a/arrow/arrow-0.15.8.tar.gz","subdirs":["linux-64"],"summary":"Better dates & times for Python","tags":null,"text_prefix":false,"timestamp":1595596181,"version":"0.8.0"},"channeldata_version":1,"feedstock":null,"labels":["main"],"package":"arrow-0.8.0-py35_0.tar.bz2","repodata":{"build":"py35_0","build_number":0,"constrains":["python_abi * *_cp35m"],"depends":["python 3.5*","python-dateutil"],"license":"Apache-2.0","license_family":"APACHE","md5":"d04dfd8fb26e7510f00c28bf47945631","name":"arrow","sha256":"d58a40a65966f377f34c7f027f7f49c98d3a91a6e4ab8dc4fdcd069a28896ce3","size":256902,"subdir":"linux-64","version":"0.8.0"},"repodata_version":1,"subdir":"linux-64","url":"https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/arrow-0.8.0-py35_0.tar.bz2"}
